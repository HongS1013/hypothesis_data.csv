The questions: what is the differences btw content analysis and content analytics? What content analytics and technique could be used in the WG project?
how would students make sense about the in-time feedback from the automatic assessment system?

How to spot the useful information is crucial facing the multitudes of messages.

not only focus on attributes of nodes but also on the network positions due to shared attributes. 
"* name: Academic Writing Analytics (AWA) * link: https://utscic.edu.au/tools/awa/ * context: immediate, personalized, better feedback for the academic writing to keep the illustration coherent and consistent is time-consuming for individual instructor. * stakeholders: UTS, academics from diverse faculties, HELPS and IML, students who use the AcaWriter. * project goals: ""make visible to learners the ways in which they are using (or failing to use) language to ‘make their thinking visible’ — i.e. construct claims and argumentative reasoning for academic writing"" through identification of linguistic patterns. * learning construct: reflection on metadiscourse to rhetoric move (not sure about this) * data sources: writings on AcaWriter * mining technique: Natural Language Processing tool to identifies concepts, people, places, and distinctively, the metadiscourse corresponding to rhetorical moves. * actions suggested/taken: rapid formative feedback (divided in disciplines and general purpose) with distinct colors, shapes and formats to indicate important aspects of reflective writing. * ethical consideration: it did not give the grading but provide feedback to improve their scholarly argument in a more logic and coherent ways. My reflection on the AcaWriter: how could this help our group project? After playing with Rocketlit, I think the grading levels might be based on the length of article, vocabulary, sentence structure, questions set. Still not very clear about the criteria and recommendation of readings for next level. Natural Language Processing...concepts... "
It might be interesting for adaptive learning owing to the tracking of learning strategies.

"More psychological. emotional words, negative, positive, authenticity, etc. It could be used to analyze the survey from emotional perspective. "
Which one could be used in our WG? The levels of reading? Is it based on the concept or the vocabulary? Or just the word counts? 
if any of us is interested: http://penoy.admu.edu.ph/~alls/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/EDM-Workbench-v4.pdf 
be careful on this point
"""Measuring Knowledge Gaps in Student Responses by Mining Networked Representations of Texts"" (LAK 9th conference) come into my mind. https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3303822 (though it's multiple choice, we may use it to set the relation between the criteria given by the Rocketlit and the criteria given by teachers)"
Why does this pattern form? what commonalities of the agents in this pattern? what factors of commonalities that influence the learning? 
mark if useful for the WG project
"Questions on prediction models. So many factors involve in the success of academic achievement, how could EMD be sure about the association of some certain behaviors? Does EMD divide the learning into specific aspects and explore into that? But what about the connection of these aspects? What about the unity or holistic development of learners?"
"""Latent knowledge is the knowledge that we have that we have not yet harnessed."" ""In theory we learn from our experiences ( hopefully). Something happens, we reflect on what has happened, and then we change our future actions as a result. But do we really learn from our experiences all that could be learned, or do we learn only part of what can possibly be learned? """
So the difference between classification and regression depends on the outcome variable's character-continuous(regression) or categorical/binary (classification). Is this the fundamental difference? More explanation: https://medium.com/quick-code/regression-versus-classification-machine-learning-whats-the-difference-345c56dd15f7
"Thanks for sharing, Xinran. More clear upon reading the article. "
"Does it mean LA has a broader focus than EDM? EDM is about learning, while LA studies all the aspects in education, including learning, teaching, and technology development, etc.? "
"What is learning? Does learning not include teaching, technology development? What are the aspects of education beyond learning? "
"I noticed that in Fig 4.1, ""all education research involves analytics and data mining"". Does it really mean ALL? How would analytics and data mining work in qualitative research? "
"analytic and data mining work could be used in the qualitative research such as the social network analysis. It might focus on the ego, the attributes of ego and the ties he/she connects with others. The methods could be flexible and it mainly depends on the research questions. "
interesting. because we use algorithms that tend to give us the result.
"thus, the criteria and parameters are the areas for hidden assumption. when changing the criteria, the cluster will change. "
exactly.Sometimes it's important to understand the black box so that we might get what we assume to get. 
This entire section of the article is relevant in the predictive analytics discussion.
"Just curious that if we use clustering analysis for prediction, then what about the individual variation? or individualized learning. "
"Still the question, who these data serve for? who benefit from these data? What is the data in the LMS for? How did the data facilitate the learners and instructor? To what extent? What is the involvement of developer?"
"who define the knowledge? who define the standard of performance? Under what rules, as educators, are we playing here? "
"""Material semiotics is a set of tools and sensibilities for exploring how practices in the social world are woven out of threads to form weaves that are simultaneously semiotic (because they are relational, and/or they carry meanings) and material (because they are about the physical stuff caught up and shaped in those relations.)"" ""It maps relations that are simultaneously material (between things) and semiotic (between concepts)"""
"Does that it turned the cluster of data, the network of different elements, into something visible, revealing the dynamic interaction between these elements? "
"Then we may ask in the LMS, what value need the analytics in LMS add? Does the information provided by the LMS meet the needs of instructors? If not, what we could add there?"
How could we find out what epistemology behind the LA tools and models? How could we make sure that the epistemology or the hidden assumption matches our own worldview? 
What theory should we use when it comes to WG project?
We may look for some articles in regard to feedback's timing and intention for our adaptive learning project.
I think timing of feedback is important for the adaptive learning. How could the adaptive learning happen when it is not too late. 
"I think when technology / LA is used for tech sake rather than in the support of good teaching & learning, the Pedagogy point in the EPA triad is lost (because that's not good teaching) and results in any of these three unintended consequences. A message I feel the authors make throughout this article is the call for educators always to be reflective practitioners in their approach to learning analytics, and the six questions that follow may offer a guide to do just that and avoid these three pitfalls."
"Agree. As the essay states earlier that we should know what we use the LA for, instead of constraining our perspectives in the processing of using LA."
"That's pretty important to build the sense of community as the lack of it would render the feeling of exclusion and isolation, which might increase the rates of dropout. In the online community of inquiry, teaching(by learners) and cognitive presence might be the key factors to form that. "
"A random analogy comes into the mind: when I lose in the video game, I always reflect on what I have done wrong (it seems like a feedback). Then regulate and do it better in the next game. "
"How could this be tracked? How could we know that the impact has sustainable effect? Could the factors we assume turn out not to be the ones that do not account for the changes? It bring me back to the paper read in session three, would the interpretation of researchers be different from the that of learners?"
"the integration of these methods are great. So if WG will use temporal analysis, what constructs to focus on in different contexts? Could I say that Hypothes.is interaction is in the online reading-interactive context, and the KF is more sequential ideas building in project-based context? Will these two lines get closer to each other? What would be the shift in this course? Some scratches for the final project."
questions to ask 
Like it.
"Does that mean associating the time with, let's say, one construct such as emotion, and then the learning analytics is based on interaction between the emotional theory and time? Like the possible shift of emotion? More specific example?"
Interested in the intertwining between the engagement and emotion under the game mechanics. 
That's the point that I need some guidance and suggestion. How could the temporal analysis in-time serve the learners?
"I am thinking of the possibility of using this as an identifier of higher level cognitive activities-exploring external resources, relating different resources, etc.."
"Xinran, would you mind illustrating how to observe this? "
Good example to combine the perspectives of stakeholders to develop prototype. How could I use it in my own project?
"Agree. The acceptance of layout is important as when it gives students the feeling of embarrassment or exclusion, it will not help them with their learning or engagement in class. Personally speaking, not like force-directed layout. "
"Or maybe vice versa. Personal experience, I also visualized a SNA for discussion in one course attended. There were peers that lingered on the edge of network, what triggered me to do was 1) contemplated over what cause this phenomenon (the time of posting, busy schedule, etc) 2) replied to his/her posts or comments more. "
"just wondering how long this iteration could be If it focuses on multiple values? Also with the change of time, the holistically addressed human value would need conceptualization again, thus how long could it be proactive?Or is it in specific context or temporal? An ongoing investigation?"
through the process of technology design
Interesting. What values are crucial to the learning but in tension? How could LA reconcile these values? 
This might be how the ethical concerns of LA are enablers instead of barriers. The perspectives of students on the data collection and use might shed a light on what they assume are important. It's also a way to build trust and reconcile the potential conflicts btw learners and institutions. It involves the accountability from both agents and institutions. 
"Fresh perspective for me, and wonder how."
"This strikes me as important. In my work in Leadership and Talent Development (LTD) at the University, we often do behavioral assessments and skills assessments, and we try to make sure we emphasize that the results are just a snapshot in time -- i.e., not necessarily determinant of you long-term. There is a limit of how we can use assessments, similar to analytics, but it's a useful tool if it's framed as capturing a temporal context."
"John: I agree with the importance of acknowledging that the data is only a snapshop view of the whole person. This principle resonates with me because students get mislabeled based solely on a test. The standardize testing in K-12 can often label schools as failing, yet they neglect to see there is so much more to the people behind the data. The recent documentary on KARE11, [Love Them First](https://www.lovethemfirst.com/) is a powerful example of how progress being made in a school is not showing up in testing. "
"Betsy, I think it's interesting to have the temporal analysis on the learning process of students, which might reveal the factors and events for the up-or-down turning point. "
"John, I am interested in the temporal analysis for the observation of dynamic process might reveal the reason for the changes"
"According to [Learning Analytics Ethical Issues and Dilemmas](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258122968_Learning_Analytics_Ethical_Issues_and_Dilemmas), ""Ethical issues for learning analytics fall into the following broad, often overlapping categories: 1. The location and interpretation of data; 2. Informed consent, privacy, and the deidentification of data; 3. The management, classification, and storage of data; Such ethical issues are not unique to education, and similar debates relating to the use of data to inform decisions and interventions are also found in the health sector, human resource management, talent management, homeland security, and biopolitics. Of specific concern here are the implications of viewing learning analytics as moral practice, recognizing students as participatory agents with developmental and temporal identities and learning trajectories and the need for reciprocal transparency. Learning analytics as moral practice functions as a counter narrative to using student data in service of neoliberal consumer-driven market ideologies"". I am looking forward to reading more on how the ethical issues are discussed in this chapter."
Chen: It's a false assumption that students know what information is collected on them and how it's used. Transparency has the potential to benefit all stakeholders when everyone has an equal understanding of what is trying be uncovered.
"Thanks for sharing, Chen. I am just wondering whether the LA could be used as moral practice as the researcher, the analytic tools, the algorithm mode etc. could direct the consequence toward the benefits of some stakeholder. "
"Agree, Betsy. It's very important to make sure that the participants understand what the information of them would be collected, how it would be used, for what purpose, who would get access to the data, and how it would be dealt with after the research. "
"When talking about educational research, I think the predictive power is always hard to pursue since the diverse and complex feature of individuals. I want to learn more about how LA will contribute to it. "
That's interesting about predictive model as it might need adjustment when it comes to a different learning context or different characteristics of learners.
A new kind of literacy is digital literacy. How can we ensure all students have equal opportunities to access the right tools in order to develop digital literacies. 
"that is a concern in the development of digital literacies: whether the technology nowadays enlarge the divide or shorten it? I have students from remote mountain areas, the computers and MOOCS open for did not fit them quite well owing to their own digital literacies and prior knowledge. Specific measurement and design needs to be done."
"Agree! The data tells a story through human lens, what is filtered, what is highlighted? Will we only see the data that we feel ""comfortable"" or interpret it in a way to our research questions?"
"Yes, it's hard to say data is always objective. While objectivity seems like the goal, the context of the collector and the usage layers on biases and subjectivity in ways we are aware of and ways we are not. Who's collecting? What are they collecting? What aren't they collecting? To what end? etc. There are many questions we can and should ask ourselves when using data."
These are great questions that I should keep in mind too. 
that is a point.
"While watching the video of George, I was impressed again by the point of weak tie for the information retrieval. It just reminded me of one video in SNA course from Bodong, giving example of that point (the team use R to do the SNA as we did). Share the link in case any of us is interested: https://youtu.be/4WOGwRQWyNM"
that's also one point I was kind of confused last year: in what way could my research be useful to other scholars and learners if it's context-based? How could it be generalized? Keep research process as detailed as possible. 
"Just wondering the impact of basic analytics on learners: will the data really help them catch up with other peers, or discourage them? "
"That's a great question. I think it might work both ways depending on the learner. More competitive, possibly higher performing students may respond positively to such data, but I can also envision a struggling student might feel discouraged and develop learned helplessness over time. "
"I've wondered that too. We've tossed around the idea in my department of having ""leaderboards"" based on activity completions/contributions. I don't know the social/psychological impact that would have -- it seems to me that it could be very motivating for some and very discouraging for others. (Context: my instructional audience is non-degree seeking, working University supervisors, so motivation for them to develop in an area that they have to balance on top of there other work duties is something we think about often)."
"It really depends on the individual characteristics as some might work harder when falling behind while some just get disheartened. It might be the time point to view the board. I just thought about basketball game: if the difference is within one-digit number, it could catch up; but when it comes to a large distance, participants are inclined to give up. "
I feel so nervous while thinking about the boards...
"This is a great question, but I wonder if it is not defined enough. I am working on a project for the University regarding undergraduate student data and degree progress toward graduation. There are so many things that are involved with a student's success and experiences at the University that some dashboards and data may have to be taken with a grain of salt and approached individually for each student. For example, a student may be showing as high-risk for graduating later than expected--is this because of the curriculum, the program requirements, or personal issues outside of school and or work? The student's advisor(s) may need to approach them first regarding their degree requirements and then ask them other questions to get to the root of the problem if the student is willing to share."
"I totally agree with that. Data give direction or trend but it needs deep inquiry to find out the reasons that form the data, which could quite complicated."
"while reading this, I am thinking about we could improve the learning process(dynamic) based on the learning outcome (static) But what does the dynamic data include? The interaction btw learner and technology? The engagement? what if the high engagement produce not satisfactory results? Will the data reveal on what part needed to be improved?"
"That's true. In the early years of teaching, few tools were used as there were only 25-30 students in one class, but in recent years when the class enrollment size reach 65 or 70, more tools are demanded to increase the engagement of students no matter in in-person and blended learning. From my perspective, technology sometimes only facilitate but give some ideas about the design of learning activities and environment. "
Very interesting to look at the data. The longest thread involves 6 peers interacting with each other on data interpretation and privacy 
possible? promoting creativity in a model which is limited itself by algorithm
very good questions 
"I am curious in the presence of instructor in this ""top-down support in a university"" "
"I am motivated to see how the physical interactions are captured from multiple perspectives to form a rich data for analysis in the article ""Towards Collaboration Translucence: Giving Meaning to Multimodal Group Data""."
"I currently working on a project that requires me to collect video, audio and pictures of teacher's ""STEM lessons"" and I would also like to dive further into more intricate ways of capturing ""physical interactions"" within these lessons and somehow quantifying it to turn it into useful data. "
That's interesting! Would you mind explaining how to data capturing process and convergence of these data? Maybe not on the hypothes.is but on the virtual meeting on Monday? 
https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0002764213479365
I am wondering how could this be modeled as it's not easy to assess the internalization of knowledge processing. 
"Focus on the route from one dot to another. How different it could be? What cause the difference? random thought: under what circumstance will we intervene? if we use the data to intervene the learning of students, how could we know our intervention would not barricade the generation of new knowledge?"
that is my focus.
"I am always interested in the generation of new knowledge and the shift of connection, i.e. how the boundaries of original connection is broken, what the features of dots that reach outside are, etc. "
what factors have limited the scope of data capture? the technology that enable data collection from multiple channels? or ethics? 
"These are valid questions. Why do we consider the scope currently to be ""limited?"" My first order thinking based off of media is that we have overwhelming amounts of data, which makes me think the scope is broad. Also when you bring up ethics, how wide open do we want these data sets to be? "
"I think there are as for data itself is rich, but probably we do not have adequate technologies or perspective to approach and capture the multi-layered and multi-dimensional data. As for ethics, there is tension between the research and protection of participants' interest. The situations would differ when it comes to specific condition. "
